# CropVision
 CropVision is a Python-based tool that leverages the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model with a ResNet-50 backbone to perform end-to-end object detection on images. It processes all images in a specified source directory, detects objects, and saves each detected object as a separate, cleanly cropped image in a destination folderâ€”without any bounding box overlays.
